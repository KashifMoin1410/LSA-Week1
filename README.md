  
\# Week 1 Python Assignment – Dataset Exploration

This repository contains the \*\*Week 1 Python assignment\*\*, completed as part of an internship learning programme.    
The assignment focuses on \*\*core Python concepts\*\* and \*\*introductory data exploration techniques\*\* using a real-world dataset.

The work reflects my ongoing learning in Python, data analysis, and modern AI-assisted development workflows.

The objective of this assignment is to:  
\- Practice Python programming fundamentals  
\- Apply basic control structures and functions  
\- Perform introductory data exploration using Pandas  
\- Visualise data using standard plotting libraries

## **3\. Assignment Tasks**

### **3.1 Dataset Metadata**

* Stored dataset metadata using Python variables  
* Displayed a formatted summary including dataset name, source, record count, and key columns

### **3.2 Null Value Validation**

* Iterated through a list of null counts  
* Identified columns with excessive missing values  
* Reported the total number of problematic columns  
* Implemented using a reusable function

### **3.3 Range Validation Using Functions**

* Stored numeric values in a list  
* Validated values against an acceptable range using a function  
* Printed validation results for each value  
* Displayed a summary of total and invalid values

### **3.4 Cars Dataset Exploration**

* Examined dataset structure and data types  
* Displayed sample records  
* Explored statistical distribution using summary statistics  
* Visualised data using scatter plots and box plots
